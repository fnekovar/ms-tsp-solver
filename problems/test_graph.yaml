# This file describes the (x,y,z) points of the recharge land stations, regular land stations and the electric towers (or pylons) of
# the complete electric graph, being the three columns the (x,y,z) coordinates and the rows different elements.
# "pylons_position_geo" is just as "pylons_position" but in geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude).
# The vector of vectors "connection_indexes" must be of the same size of "pylons_position" and represents the wire connections among
# electric towers. ATTENTION: indexes start at 1, so you may want to rest 1 at parsing to start by 0 (C++ or Python).
